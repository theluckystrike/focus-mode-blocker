      <section id="introduction">
        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Focus Mode - Blocker</strong> is a browser productivity extension developed and operated by
          <strong>Zovo</strong> (<a href="https://zovo.dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">zovo.dev</a>).
          It helps users stay focused by blocking distracting websites during focus sessions, providing
          session timers, and tracking productivity statistics.
        </p>
        <p>
          This Privacy Policy explains what data the extension collects, how that data is used,
          where it is stored, and what rights you have regarding your data. We are committed to
          transparency and to protecting your privacy.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- Section 2: Data We Collect -->
      <section id="data-we-collect">
        <h2>2. Data We Collect</h2>

        <h3>2.1 Data Stored Locally</h3>
        <p>
          Focus Mode - Blocker stores the following data locally on your device using the
          <code>chrome.storage.local</code> API. <strong>This data never leaves your browser</strong>
          unless you explicitly export it.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Blocklist:</strong> The list of websites you choose to block during focus sessions, including any active pre-built blocklist selections.</li>
          <li><strong>Timer and session state:</strong> Current timer status, session duration, and cycle information to maintain your focus session across popup opens/closes.</li>
          <li><strong>Productivity statistics:</strong> Daily focus minutes, sessions completed, distraction attempts blocked, focus score, and streak data.</li>
          <li><strong>Session history:</strong> A record of your recent focus sessions (last 7 days for free tier).</li>
          <li><strong>User preferences and settings:</strong> Theme selection, sound preferences, volume level, notification muting, schedule configuration, and nuclear mode settings.</li>
          <li><strong>Privacy preferences:</strong> Your choices regarding error logging and usage statistics collection.</li>
          <li><strong>Error log:</strong> If error logging is enabled, a log of the last 50 extension errors (auto-pruned after 7 days) to help diagnose issues.</li>
          <li><strong>Onboarding state:</strong> Whether you have completed the initial setup, install date, and total session count.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2.2 Data We Do NOT Collect</h3>
        <p>Focus Mode - Blocker does <strong>not</strong> collect, access, or store any of the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Your browsing history or the content of web pages you visit</li>
          <li>Passwords, form data, or autofill information</li>
          <li>Personal files, photos, or documents</li>
          <li>Your name, email address, or any personally identifiable information</li>
          <li>Location data or IP addresses</li>
          <li>Cookies or tracking pixels from third-party services</li>
          <li>Microphone, camera, or any device sensor data</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The extension uses the <code>declarativeNetRequest</code> permission to block websites
          you have added to your blocklist. This permission is used solely to redirect matching
          URLs to the extension's blocked page. The extension does <strong>not</strong> read, modify,
          or log the content of any web page.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <code>&lt;all_urls&gt;</code> host permission is required exclusively for the site-blocking
          functionality and the content script that detects when you navigate to a blocked site.
          No data about your browsing is transmitted anywhere.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- Section 3: How We Use Data -->
      <section id="how-we-use-data">
        <h2>3. How We Use Data</h2>
        <p>All data stored by the extension is used exclusively for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Providing core functionality:</strong> Blocking distracting websites, running focus timers, and managing your sessions.</li>
          <li><strong>Remembering your preferences:</strong> Preserving your theme choice, sound settings, blocking schedule, and other configuration between sessions.</li>
          <li><strong>Displaying your productivity statistics:</strong> Showing focus scores, session history, streaks, and distraction data on the extension's stats panel.</li>
          <li><strong>Diagnosing issues:</strong> If error logging is enabled, storing error information locally to help troubleshoot problems.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do <strong>not</strong> sell your data to any third party.</p>
        <p>We do <strong>not</strong> use your data for advertising or ad targeting.</p>
        <p>We do <strong>not</strong> use your data for profiling or behavioral analysis beyond what is displayed to you in the extension itself.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- Section 4: Data Sharing -->
      <section id="data-sharing">
        <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>We do not share, sell, rent, or transfer your data to any third party.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Focus Mode - Blocker does not include any third-party analytics services, advertising
          SDKs, or external tracking tools. All data processing happens locally on your device.
        </p>
        <p>
          No data is transmitted to Zovo's servers or any external service. The extension
          operates entirely offline after installation.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- Section 5: Data Storage and Security -->
      <section id="data-storage-security">
        <h2>5. Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <p>
          All extension data is stored locally using Chrome's <code>chrome.storage.local</code> API.
          This storage is:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Sandboxed:</strong> Chrome isolates each extension's storage, preventing other extensions or websites from accessing your Focus Mode data.</li>
          <li><strong>Per-profile:</strong> Data is tied to your Chrome profile and is not accessible from other profiles on the same computer.</li>
          <li><strong>Not encrypted at rest:</strong> While the data is isolated by Chrome's security model, it is not independently encrypted. Anyone with access to your Chrome profile data on disk could theoretically read it.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The total local storage quota for the extension is 10 MB, and a per-write safeguard
          of 5 MB prevents any single operation from consuming excessive storage.
        </p>

      <!-- Section 6: User Rights -->
      <section id="user-rights">
        <h2>6. Your Rights (GDPR/CCPA)</h2>
        <p>You have full control over your data. The following rights are available to you:</p>

        <h3>Right to Access</h3>
        <p>
          You can view all data stored by the extension at any time. Open the extension's
          Settings page and navigate to the <strong>Privacy &amp; Data</strong> section to see
          a summary of stored data.
        </p>

        <h3>Right to Export (Data Portability)</h3>
        <p>
          You can export all of your data as a JSON file using the <strong>"Export My Data"</strong>
          button in the Privacy &amp; Data section of Settings. The export includes all storage
          keys, values, and metadata.
        </p>

        <h3>Right to Delete (Right to Erasure)</h3>
        <p>
          You can permanently delete all extension data using the <strong>"Delete All Data"</strong>
          button in the Privacy &amp; Data section of Settings. This action is irreversible and
          will remove all stored preferences, statistics, blocklists, and session history.
        </p>

        <h3>Right to Opt Out</h3>
        <p>
          You can disable optional data collection features at any time via the privacy toggle
          controls in the Privacy &amp; Data section of Settings. You can independently control:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Error logging:</strong> Disable to stop recording error information.</li>
          <li><strong>Usage statistics:</strong> Disable to stop collecting session and productivity stats.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>CCPA Disclosure</h3>
        <p>
          Under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA): <strong>We do not sell personal
          information.</strong> Focus Mode - Blocker does not collect personal information as
          defined by the CCPA, and no data is shared with or sold to third parties.
        </p>

        <h3>GDPR Legal Basis</h3>
        <p>
          For users in the European Economic Area (EEA), our legal basis for processing data
          is <strong>legitimate interest</strong> -- specifically, the legitimate interest of
          providing the core functionality of the extension that you have chosen to install.
          For optional features such as error logging, the legal basis is your explicit
          <strong>consent</strong>, which you can withdraw at any time by disabling the
          relevant toggles.

        <p>
          Focus Mode - Blocker is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not
          knowingly collect any data from children. Since the extension does not collect
          personal information from any user, there is no risk of inadvertent collection
          of children's data.
